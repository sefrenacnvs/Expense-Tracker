# Expense-Tracker
Managing personal finances is challenging as people often forget where money goes. This project presents an Expense Tracker using Python and Streamlit to record, categorize, and analyze income and expenses. It computes savings, stores data in CSV, and uses charts to provide clear insights into spending patterns.
